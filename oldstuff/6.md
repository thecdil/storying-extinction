## Caribou are gods

### Full Width Image

Though inconvenient, I do appreciate the snow. It carries with it, in some capacity, the spirit of the caribou whose lives were inextricably linked to its presence here. And this is the first snowfall in many hundreds of years that will turn to runoff and become a major part of this watershed without carrying with it the tracks of these animals.

Somehow, being here on the edge of this patch of slowly melting ground is like witnessing the first traces of caribou absenceâ€”not as a singular event instantiated by their forced removal, but as a process that began long ago, one that will continue to permeate this landscape in ways both visible and invisible. 




Code to make this:

``` {% raw %} 
{% include feature/figure-full-page.html objectid="Coyote-SP"%}
{% endraw %}```
