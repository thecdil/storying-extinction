### Map is working

Lots of options to talk about! The map below is filtered via the include to only include items that are on youtube. You could filter however you want, really. Wondering whether many maps == deep map???

Code to make this map:

``` {% raw %} {% include feature/map.html filter="item.youtubeid" zoom="12" latitude="48.768722" longitude="-116.624056" basemap="OpenTopoMap" %}{% endraw %}```

{% include feature/map.html filter="item.youtubeid" zoom="12" latitude="48.768722" longitude="-116.624056" basemap="OpenTopoMap" style="border-radius: 20% 40% 0% 50%;margin-left:-5%;"%}
